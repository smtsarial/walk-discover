Hello everyone, 
I am very happy to announce my first reactJS project with you. I 
struggled to learn how to react, and after my reaction course I started 
developing this project to practice. It's name is  Walk & 
Discover.It basicly getting cool walking videos from the youtube and 
streaming on my page.

Most of us haven't done much traveling in the past year, thanks to 
the coronavirus pandemic. So, it's been a while since we've had the 
pleasant experience of walking, through another city, taking in the 
sights and the sounds.
